Let's solve the equation, "three x plus four equals seven."

Our first goal is to isolate the term with the variable x, which means getting x by itself on one side of the equation.~

To do this, we need to eliminate the number added to x, which in our case is four. We'll do this by subtracting four from both sides of the equation.~

Subtracting four from the left side leaves us with "three x," and subtracting four from the right side gives us three.~

Now, our equation is simplified to "three x equals three."~

The next step is to solve for x by eliminating the coefficient, which is the number in front of x. In this case, it's three.~

We eliminate this by dividing both sides of our equation by three.~

When we divide three x by three, we're left with just "x."~

On the right side of the equation, dividing three by three gives us one.~

So the solution to the equation is "x equals one."~

Finally, let's double-check our solution by plugging x equals one back into the original equation to ensure it balances.~

If we replace x with one, we get "three times one plus four."~

Three times one equals three, and adding four gives us seven, which matches the original equation perfectly, confirming our solution.~

Therefore, x equals one is indeed the correct solution to the equation.
